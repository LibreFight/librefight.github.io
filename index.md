# Hello and welcome to the LibreFight website!
## We do not have a definite roadmap:
- 1. make skeleton
- 2. plan on characters (SuperTux, OpenSuspect, etc.)
- 3. plan on modes
- 4. framework for extensions
- 5. wherever we go

Our game engine would probably be Godot or UPBGE. We want to use a FOSS game engine.
